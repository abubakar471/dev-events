# (frontend) implementing posthog for analytics
implement posthog right after creating the first component may be the hero. so that you can develop and track from the very first moment

npx -y @posthog/wizard@latest

then create a providers.tsx in the app directory

and then wrap the root layout.tsx file with the provider

you can also manually trigger events

Optional: Send a manual event
If you'd like, you can manually define events, too.

posthog.capture('my event', { property: 'value' })

# (backend) prompt for generating database models and prehooks

you are a backend developer working on a **Next.js application with Mongoose and Typescript**. Your task is to build a **database layer** with two Mongoose models, 'Events' and 'Booking' in a new database folder

**You must create exactly three files**
1. 'event.model.ts'
2. 'booking.model.ts'
3. 'index.ts'

### 1. 'database/event.model.ts'

create a strongly typed Mongoose schema and model called **Event** with the following fields:

- 'title' - string, required
- 'slug' - string, required
- 'description' - string, required
- 'overview' - string, required
- 'image' - string, required
- 'venue' - string, required
- 'location' - string, required
- 'date' - string, required
- 'time' - string, required
- 'mode' string (e.g. online, offline, hybrid), required
- 'audience' - string, required
- 'agenda' - array of strings, required
- 'createdAt' - date, auto-generated
- 'updatedAt' - date, auto-generated

**Requirements**

- Use a **pre-save hook** to automatically generate a URL-friendly slug from the title
- Only regenerate the slug if the title changes
- In the same pre-save hook, **validate and normalize the 'date' ** to ISO format and ensure 'time' is stored in a consistent format.
- Validate that required fields are present and non-empty
- Add a ** unique index ** to the slug
- Enable automatic timestamps
- Use **strict Typescript types ** (no 'any')
- write **concise comments** explaining key logic such as slug generation, date formatting, and validation.

### 2. 'database/booking.model.ts'

Create a strongly typed Mongoose schema and model called **Booking** with the following fields

- 'eventId' - ObjectId (reference to 'Event'), required
- 'email' - string, required, must be a valid email
- 'createdAt' - date, auto-generated
- 'updatedAt' - date, auto-generated

**Requirements**

- In a **pre-save hook**, verify that the referenced `eventId` corresponds to an existing `Event`. Throw an error if not exist.
- Validate that `email` is properly formatted.
- Add an index on `eventId` for faster queries.
- Enable automatic timestamps.
- Use **strong TypeScript types** throughout.
- Include **concise comments** explaining pre-save validation and schema design decisions.


### 3. 'database/index.ts'
- Export both Event and Booking models so they can be imported anywhere in the application from a single file.

---

✅ **Final Deliverable:**

- Exactly three files: 'event.model.ts', 'booking.model.ts', and 'index.ts'.
- 
- Each model must use **pre-save hooks** for slug generation, date normalization, and reference validation.
- Code should be **production-grade**, **clean**, **type-safe**, and **clear to understand**.

- Include only **meaningful, concise comments** — no unnecessary explanations.
